One of my favorite pastimes over winter break is to play Taboo, a popular board game from Milton Bradley.  Billed as "The Game of Unspeakable Fun", Taboo is a spoken word game that involves trying to get your team to guess a secret word without using any of five clue words specified as "taboo".  How, for example, would you describe the word kitten without using the words meow, cat, purr, furry, or animal?  As a player gives clues, he is constantly monitored by a member of the opposing team; if he makes any mistakes, he is unceremoniously "buzzed" and a point is deducted from his team's score.
